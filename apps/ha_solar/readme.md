# Solar Stats

I used the [Solar Manager applet](https://github.com/tidbyt/community/tree/main/apps/solarmanagerch) as a source, mainly because I liked the screens implemented in there. I modified it to pull the data from Home Assistant instead of a portal. This allows us to get Home Assistant connected to whatever provider you have (Enphase Envoy in my case, and this data is pulled locally).

This applet requires:
- Entity ID containing the current production numbers in Watts (power being generated by the solar panels)
- Entity ID containing the current consumption numbers in Watts (power being used by the home)
- Home Assistant URL (including http and the port number, ie, http://homeassitant.local:8123)
- Long-Lived Access Token for Home Assistant. This needs to be Created in HA under [User Settings](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/), at the bottom.
